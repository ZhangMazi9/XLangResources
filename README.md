**X Language** is a next-generation unified modeling language designed for complex systems across multiple domains. Its primary goal is to enable comprehensive modeling and simulation throughout the entire lifecycle of complex systems—including requirements, design, and verification—across various disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, and control systems. It supports multi-level granularity (from components, assemblies, and devices to subsystems, systems, and even systems-of-systems) and accommodates diverse system characteristics, including continuous, discrete, hybrid, and intelligent behaviors.

X Language fully supports **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)**. During the conceptual design phase, it provides a standardized graphical modeling environment. These graphical models can be automatically compiled and transformed into textual low-level simulation models. Driven by a simulation engine, X Language enables seamless and integrated simulation across the full system and lifecycle from multiple perspectives. This facilitates a unified and integrated approach to concept model design, system architecture development, multi-physics modeling, and simulation execution.
